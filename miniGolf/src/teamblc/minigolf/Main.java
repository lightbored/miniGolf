    static Round newRound ( String courseName, String playerName ) 
This method creates and stores a new round object, and returns a reference to that Round object.
static Round getRound (String player, String courseName ) 
This method looks up the Round object.  Note it isn't specified how you store Round objects, but a likely choice is some sort of “Collection”.  Keep in mind the garbage collection requirements for this object, discussed above.
static Course getCourse ( String courseName ) 
Returns a Course object.  These must be persisted to storage but there aren't many courses so creating a “Collection” to hold them all, read from a file say, is reasonable.  However exactly how you do this is an implementation detail.
static int scoreSoFar( String courseName, String playerName ) 
This method looks up the round information and returns it's score so far to the swipe station, to display.  (Yes it is redundant with Round.currentScore(), but the customer insisted — probably has a nephew or niece who is a “computer expert”.)
static void enterStrokes ( String courseName, String playerName, int strokes ) 
This method is redundant.  It also will be used by the swipe-station once a player hits the button for their number of strokes for that hole.
Getters for the properties: course list, round list.
